        <p>For me, the most important file is all the folders that saved works from my previous semesters. I think it is
            always
            necessary to organized and categorized files, so when I am searching for works I have done, it will be very
            easy and
            convenient. Also, if I need to revise or go over an old version of the design, I could easily find it in the
            particular
            folder. One more thing I guess I could do is to back up those folders in another platform, such as drive and
            cloud, so I
            donâ€™t need to worry about losing them.
