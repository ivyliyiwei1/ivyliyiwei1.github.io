            <h3>What is chess?</h3>
            <div class="introbox">Chess is a
                recreational and competitive board game played between two players. It is sometimes called
                Western or
                international chess to distinguish it from related games such as xiangqi. The current form of the game
                emerged in
                Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from similar, much older games
                of Indian and
                Persian origin. Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people
                worldwide at home,
                in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Chess is an abstract strategy game and involves
                no hidden information. It is played on a square chessboard with 64
                squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. At the start, each player (one controlling the white pieces,
                the other
                controlling the black pieces) controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two
                bishops, and
                eight pawns. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, whereby the king is under
                immediate attack (in
                "check") and there is no way to remove it from attack on the next move. There are also several ways a
                game can end in a
                draw.

                Organized chess arose in the 19th century. Chess competition today is governed internationally by FIDE
                (International
                Chess Federation). The first universally recognized World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his
                title in 1886;
                Magnus Carlsen is the current World Champion. A huge body of chess theory has developed since the game's
                inception.
                Aspects of art are found in chess composition; and chess in its turn influenced Western culture and art
                and has
                connections with other fields such as mathematics, computer science, and psychology.

                One of the goals of early computer scientists was to create a chess-playing machine. In 1997, Deep Blue
                became the first
                computer to beat the reigning World Champion in a match when it defeated Garry Kasparov. Today's chess
                engines are
                significantly stronger than even the best human players, and have deeply influenced the development of
                chess theory.</div>

            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <div class="whitebox">The rules of chess are published by FIDE (Fédération Internationale des Échecs),
                chess's international
                governing body,
                in its Handbook. Rules published by national governing bodies, or by unaffiliated chess
                organizations, commercial
                publishers, etc., may differ. FIDE's rules were most recently revised in 2018.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="detail">
            <p class="sec">Setup</p>
            <p>Chess pieces are divided into white and black sets. While the sets may not be literally white and black
                (e.g. the light
                set may be a yellowish or off-white color, the dark set may be red), they are always referred to as
                "white"
                and "black".
                Each set consists of 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight
                pawns.
                The pieces
                are set out as shown in the diagram and photo. The players of the sets are referred to as White and
                Black,
                respectively.

                The game is played on a square board of eight rows (called ranks, denoted 1 to 8 from bottom to top
                according to White's
                perspective) and eight columns (called files, denoted a to h from left to right according to White's
                perspective). The
                64 squares alternate in color and are referred to as light and dark squares. The chessboard is placed
                with a
                light
                square at the right-hand corner nearest to each player. Thus, each queen starts on a square of its own
                color
                (the white
                queen on a light square; the black queen on a dark square).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="detail">
            <p class="sec">Movement</p>
            <p>In competitive games, the colors are allocated by the organizers; in informal games, the colors are
                usually decided
                randomly, for example by a coin toss, or by one player concealing a white pawn in one hand and a black
                pawn in the
                other, and having the opponent choose. White moves first, after which players alternate turns, moving
                one piece per turn
                (except for castling, when two pieces are moved). A piece is moved to either an unoccupied square or one
                occupied by an
                opponent's piece, which is captured and removed from play. With the sole exception of en passant, all
                pieces capture by
                moving to the square that the opponent's piece occupies.

                Moving is compulsory; it is illegal to skip a turn, even when having to move is detrimental. A player
                may not make any
                move that would put or leave the player's own king in check. If the player to move has no legal move,
                the game is over;
                the result is either checkmate (a loss for the player with no legal move) if the king is in check, or
                stalemate (a draw)
                if the king is not.

                Each piece has its own way of moving. In the diagrams, the dots mark the squares to which the piece can
                move if there
                are no intervening piece(s) of either color (except the knight, which leaps over any intervening
                pieces).</p>

            <h2>End of the game</h2>
            <p class="sec">Check and checkmate</p>
            <div class="whitebox1">When a king is under immediate attack by one or two of the opponent's pieces, it is
                said to be in check. A move in
                response to a check is legal only if it results in a position where the king is no longer in check. This
                can involve
                capturing the checking piece; interposing a piece between the checking piece and the king (which is
                possible only if the
                attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is a square between it and the king); or moving
                the king to a
                square where it is not under attack. Castling is not a permissible response to a check.

                The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is in check,
                and there is no
                legal way to remove it from attack. It is never legal for a player to make a move that puts or leaves
                the player's own
                king in check. In casual games, it is common to announce "check" when putting the opponent's king in
                check, but this is
                not required by the rules of chess and is not usually done in tournaments.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="twoimages">
            <ul>
                <li><img id="myimage" src="img/end1.png"></img>The black king is in check by the rook.</li>
                <li><img id="myimage" src="img/end2.png"></img>White is in checkmate, being unable to escape attack by
                    the black bishop on f3.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="detail">
            <p class="sec" id="seca">Stalemate and dead position</p>
            <p>If the player to move has no legal moves, but is not in check, the position is
                a
                stalemate, and the game is drawn.

                If the game reaches a dead position, in which neither player is able to checkmate the other by any legal
                sequence of
                moves, the game is drawn. For example, if only the kings are on the board, all other pieces having been
                captured,
                checkmate is impossible and the game is drawn by this rule.

                On the other hand, if both players still have a knight there is a highly unlikely yet theoretical
                possibility of
                checkmate, so this rule does not apply. This rule supersedes the previous rule which referred to
                "insufficient
                material", extending it to include other positions where checkmate is impossible such as blocked pawn
                endings where the
                pawns cannot be attacked.</p>
