        <h3>Ingredient</h3>
        <div id="ingredient">Lemons: Fresh lemons are essential for this recipe to get that great fresh-squeezed
            lemonade taste. Depending on the
            size of your lemons, you will need between 6-8 medium size lemons to get 1 1/2 cups of lemon juice for this
            recipe. <br>
            Sugar: White granulated sugar gets dissolved in water to create a simple syrup.<br>
            Water: How much water you add really depends on how sweet you like your lemonade.</div>
        <p id="lemon">function makeLemonade (lemon, water, honey) { <br>
            let lemonade = lemon + water + honey;<br>

    <h1 class="recipe2">How to make milktea</h1>
    <div class="p2">
        <h3>Ingredient</h3>
        <div id="ingredient">
            Lipton Tea; milk; water</div>
        <br>


        <div id="milktea">function makeMilktea (boiledwater, tea, milk) { <br>
            let milktea = boiledwater + tea + milk;<br>
            return milktea <br>
            }</div>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        1.Add a Lipton Black Tea teabag to your favorite cup. <br>
        2.<span class="bold">Boil </span>water and pour it over the teabag.<br>
        3.<span class="bold">Wait 3 to 5 minutes</span>for the tea to brew, without
        stirring or squeezing the teabag.<br>
        4.Remove the teabag and pour in a dash of milk. Note: milk should act as a flavor-enhancer, so you only
        need
        enough to add
        creaminess. Too much milk will mask the taste of the tea. Judge it by the change color as you add the
        milk
        and
        aim for
        an even shade - a very pale brown means you've probably poured in too much.<br>
        5.<span class="bold">Stir</span> with a spoon to blend evenly.<br>
