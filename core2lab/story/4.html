        <p>“What’s the matter, and why are you fretting about my lake?” the majestic old man demanded.

            “I ... I dropped my axe into the water,” the logger replied, utterly speechless.

            The old man disappeared back into the water without a word, only to reappear moments later with an axe in
            each
            hand. One
            was made of gold, the other of silver.
