    <div class="text">
        <p>The work must have been strenuous, for the diligent logger quickly tired. “Just a little while longer and
            I’ll

            break,” he thought, as his technique began to falter. Fatigue got the better of him, and the logger’s hand

            sending his tool spiraling into the nearby pond.
