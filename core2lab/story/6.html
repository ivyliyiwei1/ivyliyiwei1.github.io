        <p>The old man was moved by the loggerâ€™s honesty. He decided to reward the logger by giving him all three axes.
            The
            unexpected present made the logger rich, and he lived comfortably for the rest of his days. In a nearby
            village,
            another
            logger, one who was not so honest, heard what had happened. The greedy logger hurried over to the honest
            logger
            and
            asked him for details.</p>
