        <h1>Which axe is yours?: A tale of three axes teaches that honesty prevails</h1>
        <p>Once upon a time in a distant land, there lived an honest logger. His axe was not particularly valuable, for
            it
            was old,
            made of impure metal and was partly rusted, but it served its purpose well. On a regular day just like any
            other, the
            logger went up to the mountains and, after finding a nice spot next to a lake, began splitting logs.</p>
