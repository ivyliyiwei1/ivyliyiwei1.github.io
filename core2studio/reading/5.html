            <p class="maincontent" id="content5">A Japanese room might be likened to an inkwash painting, the
                paper-paneled
                shoji being the expanse where the ink is
                thinnest, and the alcove where it is darkest. Whenever I see the alcove of a tastefully built Japanese
                room,
                I marvel at
                our comprehension of the secrets of shadows, our sensitive use of shadow and light. For the beauty of
                the
                alcove is not
                the work of some clever device. An empty space is marked off with plain wood and plain walls, so that
                the
                light drawn
                into it forms dim shadows within emptiness. There is nothing more. And yet, when we gaze into the
                darkness
                that gathers
                behind the crossbeam, around the flower vase, beneath the shelves, though we know perfectly well it is
                mere
                shadow, we
                are overcome with the feeling that in this small corner of the atmosphere there reigns complete and
                utter
                silence; that
                here in the darkness immutable tranquility holds sway. The<span class="glow"> "mysterious Orient"</span>
                of
                which Westerners speak
                probably refers
                to the uncanny silence of these dark places. And even we as children would feel an inexpressible chill
                as we
                peered into
                the depths of an alcove to which the sunlight had never penetrated. Where lies the key to this mystery?
                illtimately it
                is the magic of shadows. Were the shadows to be banished from its comers, the alcove would in that
                instant
                revert to
                mere void.
                <br><br>
                This was the genius of our ancestors, that by cutting off the light from this empty space they imparted
                to
                the world of
                shadows that formed there a quality of mystery and depth superior to that of any wall painting or
                ornament.
                The
                technique seems simple, but was by no means so simply achieved. We can imagine with little difficulty
                what
                extraordinary
                pains were taken with each invisible detail-the placement of the window in the shelving recess, the
                depth of
                the
                crossbeam, the height of the threshold. But for me the most exquisite touch is-the <span
                    class="glow">pale
                    white glow </span>of the
                shoji in the
                study bay; I need only pause before it and I forget the passage of time.
