    <div class="pt4box" id="pt4first">Of course the Japanese room does have its picture alcove, and in it

    <br>
    <div id="scroll">But the scroll and the flowers serve not as ornament but rather to give depth to the shadows. We
        value a scroll above
        all for the way it blends with the walls of the alcove, and thus we consider the mounting quite as important as
        the
        calligraphy or painting. Even the greatest masterpiece will lose its worth as a scroll if it fails to blend with
        the
        alcove, while a work of no particular distinction may blend beautifully with the room and set off to unexpected
        advantage both itself and its surroundings. Wherein lies the power of an otherwise ordinary work to produce such
        an
        effect? Most often the paper, the ink, the fabric of the mounting will possess a certain look of antiquity, and
        this
        look of antiquity will strike just the right balance with the darkness of the alcove and room.

        We have all had the experience, on a visit to one of the great temples of Kyoto or Nara, of being shown a
        scroll, one of
        the temple's treasures, hanging in a large, deeply recessed alcove. So dark are these alcoves, even in bright
        daylight,
        that we can hardly discern the outlines of the work; all we can do is listen to the explanation of the guide,
        follow as
        best we can the all-but invisible brush strokes, and tell ourselves how magnificent a painting it must be. Yet
        the
        combination of that blurred old painting and the dark alcove is one of absolute harmony. The lack of clarity,
        far from
        disturbing us, seems rather to suit the painting <a id="pt4next" href="pt5.html">perfectly.</a></div>
