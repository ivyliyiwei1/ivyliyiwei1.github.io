                <p>There are of course roofs on Western houses too, but they are less to keep off the sun than to keep
                    off the wind and the
                    dew; even from without it is apparent that they are built to create as few shadows as possible and
                    to expose the
                    interior to as much light as possible.</p>

                <p>If the roof of a Japanese house is a parasol, the roof of a Western house is no more than a cap, with
                    as small a visor
                    as possible so as to allow the sunlight to penetrate directly beneath the eaves. There are no doubt
                    all sorts of
                    reasons-climate, building materials-for the deep Japanese eaves. The fact that we did not use glass,
                    concrete, and
                    bricks, for instance, made a low roof necessary to keep off the driving wind and rain.</p>

                    we call beauty,

                    rooms, presently came to
                    discover beauty in shadows, ultimately to guide shadows towards beauty's <a href="pt3.html"
