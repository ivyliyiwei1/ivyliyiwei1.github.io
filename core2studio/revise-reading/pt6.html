            And surely you have seen, in the darkness of the innermost rooms of these huge buildings, to which sunlight
            never
            penetrates, how the gold leaf of a sliding door or screen will pick up a distant glimmer from the garden,
            then suddenly
            send forth an ethereal glow, a faint golden light cast into the enveloping darkness, like the glow upon the
            horizon at
            sunset. In no other setting is gold quite so exquisitely beautiful. You walk past, turning to look again,
            and yet again;
            and as you move away the golden surface of the paper glows ever more deeply, changing not in a flash, but
            growing
            slowly, steadily brighter, like color rising in the face of a giant. Or again you may find that the gold
            dust of the
            background, which until that moment had only a dull, sleepy luster, will, as you move past, suddenly gleam
            forth as if
            it had burst into flame.

            How, in such a dark place, gold draws so much light to itself is a mystery to me. But I see why in ancient
            times statues
            of the Buddha were gilt with gold and why gold leaf covered the walls of the homes of the nobility. Modem
            man, in his
            well-lit house, knows nothing of the beauty of gold; but those who lived in the dark houses of the past were
            not merely
            captivated by its beauty, they also knew its practical value; for gold, in these dim rooms, must have served
            the
            function of a reflector. Their use of gold leaf and gold dust was not mere extravagance. Its reflective
            properties were
            put to use as a source of illumination. Silver and other metals quickly lose their gloss, but gold retains
            its
            brilliance indefinitely to light the darkness of the room. This is why gold was held in such incredibly high
            esteem.
