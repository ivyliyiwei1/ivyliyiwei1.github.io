    <div class="pt3box" id="pt3first">And so it has come to be that the beauty of a Japanese room depends on a variation
        of shadows,
        <br><span id="heavy" onclick="pt3showheavy()">heavy shadows</span> against
        <span id="light" onclick="pt3showlight()">light shadows</span>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div id="black">-it has nothing else. Westerners are amazed at the simplicity of Japanese
        rooms, perceiving in them
        no more
        than ashen walls bereft of ornament. Their reaction is understandable, but it betrays a failure to comprehend
        the
        mystery of shadows.</div>
    <br>
    <div id="white">Out beyond the sitting room, which the rays of the sun can at best but barely reach,
        we extend
        the eaves or build on a
        veranda, putting the sunlight at still greater a remove. The light from the garden steals in but dimly through
        paper-paneled doors, and it is precisely this indirect light that makes for us the charm of a room. We do our
        walls in
        neutral colors so that the sad, fragile, dying rays can sink into absolute repose. The storehouse, kitchen,
        hallways,
        and such may have a glossy finish, but the walls of the sitting room will almost always be of day textured with
        fine
        sand. A luster here would destroy the soft fragile beauty of the feeble light.</div>
    <br>
    <div id="black1">We delight in the mere sight of the delicate glow of fading rays clinging to
        the
        surface of a
        dusky wall, there to live
        out what little life remains to them. We never tire of the sight, for to us this pale glow and these dim shadows
        far
        surpass any ornament. And so, as we must if we are not to disturb the glow, we finish the walls with sand in a
        single
        neutral color. The hue may differ from room to room, but the degree of difference will be ever so slight; not so
        much a
        difference in color as in shade, a difference that will seem to exist only in the mood of the viewer. And from
        these
        delicate differences in the hue of the walls, the shadows in each room take on a tinge <a id="pt4next"
            href="pt4.html">peculiarly their own.</a></div>
